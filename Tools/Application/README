		How to use the application
---------------------------------------------

At the top of the application, you have 6 buttons which open
6 pages.

The first one is the home page. You can choose the language
between english, french and russian. By default, it's in english.

The second page is for selecting the file. You can
select a .dat or .nc file and the file need to have a particular
construction.

The next pages are plots but you can't open them
if you haven't chosen a file.
In the third page, you plot particles with a specific energy 
and show their positions. You can change the face, the range of 
the slice and the range of the energy values. Clicking on the
Cluster button identifies the clusters and their center, and plot
them. Then clicking on a cluster center plots the electric field
in this center.
In the fourth page, there is a histogram of the energy distribution 
of the particles.
In the fifth page, you plot particles with a specific velocity 
and show their positions. You can change the face, the range of 
the slice and the range of the velocity values. 
In the sixth one, there is a histogram of the velocity distribution 
of the particles.
You can save those plots whenever you want.
